Showcase-AI ⚖️🤖

Next-generation AI demos for the legal industry.

This repository brings together a collection of AI-powered prototypes built to transform the way legal professionals work.
Each demo is designed to be practical, fast to test, and directly applicable to real-world legal workflows.

📂 Branches and Demos

demo_1_clasificador_docs → Instantly classify legal documents (contracts, rulings, regulations, and more).

demo_2_redaccion_contratos → An AI assistant for drafting contracts: generate, refine, and strengthen legal clauses in seconds.

demo_3_buscador_sentencias → A semantic search engine that retrieves the most relevant legal rulings based on natural language queries.

🚀 Why this matters

Legal work is time-consuming, repetitive, and detail-heavy.
With these demos you will see how AI can:

✅ Save hours of manual review
✅ Improve accuracy and consistency in documents
✅ Unlock powerful insights from unstructured legal texts

This is not theory — these are hands-on demos you can run today.
